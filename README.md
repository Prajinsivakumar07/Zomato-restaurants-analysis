Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis Project: This project involved analyzing Zomato restaurant data using advanced Excel functions and SQL queries, and creating interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau, and provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about these tools and techniques.

Excel To achieve the objectives of the Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis project, various advanced Excel functions were used, including:
SUMIFS and COUNTIFS functions to extract and count data based on specific criteria PivotTables and PivotCharts to summarize and analyze data Conditional formatting to highlight key insights in the data Report connections to link multiple PivotTables and charts to a single slicer, allowing for dynamic filtering of the data VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH functions to merge data from different tables DATE and YEAR functions to extract information from date fields

SQL To extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset, SQL queries were executed to to perform calculations on subsets of data Date functions, such as DATEADD, DATEDIFF, and DATEPART, to extract information from date fields and perform date calculations

Power BI To visualize and analyze the Zomato restaurant data, Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards and 
Data modeling using relationships between tables and calculated columns Measures and DAX formulas to perform calculations on the data Visualizations such as tables, charts, and maps to display the data Slicers and filters to enable dynamic filtering
